# Heatmapper
This creates Heatmaps easily.
This Projects consists of two Python scripts. Heatmapper does the actual heatmapp creation. UI.py creates a suitable .csv file and then creates a heatmap.
UI uses Tkinter, while Heatmapper uses seaborn. Two parameters can be entered per Grid field, the left relates to the colour parameter while the right is displayed as a number in the field. This could be used for Yield and recovered starting material respectively.

Suitable .csv files have the following format:
  Label,Label,Label,
